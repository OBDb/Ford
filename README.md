# Ford Motor Company

This repository serves as the default fallback signalset configuration for Ford vehicles when a specific make does not have its own signalset definitions. It contains generic signal mappings that can be applied across various Ford models, while model-specific repositories should be consulted for more accurate configurations.

## About Ford Motor Company

Ford Motor Company is an American multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan. Founded by Henry Ford in 1903, the company has grown to become one of the largest and most influential automotive companies in the world.

## Generations

### Early Years (1903-1927)
The company began with the production of the Model A in 1903, but achieved true success with the introduction of the Model T in 1908. The revolutionary assembly line production method implemented by Ford in 1913 dramatically reduced manufacturing costs, making automobiles accessible to the middle class. By 1927, over 15 million Model T cars had been produced.

### Expansion and Innovation (1927-1945)
This era saw the introduction of the Model A (1927) and the Ford V8 (1932), which brought affordable V8 power to the masses. During World War II, Ford shifted production to military equipment, including bombers and jeeps, demonstrating the company's manufacturing versatility.

### Post-War Boom (1945-1970)
The post-war period marked significant growth for Ford with iconic models like the F-Series trucks (1948), which would become America's best-selling vehicle line. The company introduced the Thunderbird in 1955 and the legendary Mustang in 1964, which created the "pony car" segment and became one of the most successful car launches in automotive history.

### Modernization and Challenges (1970-2000)
This period was characterized by responses to changing market dynamics, including the oil crisis and increasing international competition. Ford introduced smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles like the Fiesta and Focus globally. The company also established the luxury Lincoln division and acquired stakes in Mazda, Aston Martin, Jaguar, and Volvo.

### Digital Age and Sustainability (2000-Present)
In recent decades, Ford has focused on technological innovation, sustainability, and mobility solutions. The company has invested heavily in electric vehicles with models like the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, hybrid technology, autonomous driving research, and digital connectivity features. Under the "One Ford" strategy, the company has worked to unify its global operations and streamline its product lineup.

## Signal Configuration Guidelines

When using this repository as a fallback, please note that:

1. Signal definitions may require adjustment based on specific model years and trim levels
2. Powertrain signals (engine, transmission) will vary significantly between models
3. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have model-specific implementations
4. Whenever possible, use the model-specific signal configuration repository instead
